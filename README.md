This project was made in the context of the 2021 Physics Hackathon held by McGill University. 
You can see [our submition here](https://devpost.com/software/multibody-pendulum-visualization-tool).

# Features
- Allows user to visualize a real-time simulation of a multibody pendulum while modifying the factors influencing its behaviors.
- Lets instructor demo the behavior of certain systems while showcasing the chaotic nature of multibody pendulums via the path-plot as well as the phase-space plot.

# Usage
Visit [this website](https://yaeldemers.com/multibody-pendulum-visualization/index.html) and start playing with the pendulums. As this project will progress, more simulations should become available for general use.

# Examples of visualization
![Double pendulum undamped simulation which ran for a long time while displaying the space-phase plot of theta-1 vs.theta-2](/images/double-pendulum-with-phase-space.PNG)
Double pendulum simulation with undamped motion - it ran for a long time while displaying the space-phase plot of theta-1 versus theta-2
